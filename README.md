# 🔥 **Tempercore Language Overview**

## 🧠 *Code with Intuition. Execute with Precision.*

**Tempercore** is a next-generation **instruction-oriented programming language** built for engineers, thinkers, builders, and system designers who crave elegant structure, real-time introspection, and expressive, semantic control over logic and memory.

Inspired by the architectural clarity of assembly, the flow readability of Python, and the memory handling rigor of C/C++, Tempercore is **not just another language**—it’s a **thought framework**, an **execution model**, and a **procedural artform**.

---

## 🌟 Key Highlights

### ✅ Instruction-First Syntax

Tempercore is structured as an intuitive **cascade of commands**, favoring:

* **Readability without verbosity**
* **Clear separation of control, memory, and logic**
* **Stack and heap interactions** as first-class citizens

```tempercore
define heap
allocate buffer 128
stack push "Welcome"
print "Buffer Ready"
```

---

### 🧩 Modular Design, AOT Compiled

* Fully **Ahead-of-Time compiled**
* Modular, structured `.tpc` files
* Compiles to valid, optimized **Python** (with future support for C++ and NASM)
* `use stdlib` enables access to Tempercore’s built-in math, string, and data libraries

---

### 💾 Explicit Memory + Real-Time Visualization

Tempercore treats memory as a visible, controlled domain:

* `stack push/pop`, `heap allocate/retrieve/delete`
* Thread-safe memory ops
* Live visualizations in the GUI IDE
* Mutex locks for multithreaded environments

---

### 🧠 Built-in Standard Library

With a single line:

```tempercore
use stdlib
```

You gain access to:

* `factorial`, `prime`, `gcd`, `lcm`
* `reverse_string`, `count_words`, `to_upper/lower`
* `extract_numbers`, `frequency_map`, and more

Call functions like:

```tempercore
let result = T.factorial(6)
print result
```

---

### 🖥 GUI IDE with Live Stack/Heap Panels

Tempercore ships with a custom PyQt-powered desktop environment:

* Monaco-style editor
* File load/save with `.tpc` syntax
* Console output
* Real-time stack/heap display panel
* Error display, inspection-ready

---

### 🧬 Philosophical Architecture

> **Tempercore is not about simulation. It’s about control.**

Every design decision favors **explicit outcomes**, **silent recursion**, **modular reasoning**, and **intuitive command composition**. This is a language for people who think structurally, act decisively, and build coherently.

---

## 🚀 Example Program

```tempercore
use stdlib

function show_factors:
    let result = T.prime(31)
    print "Is 31 prime?:", result

stack push "done"
heap allocate count 12
```

AOT-Compiled

🧾 Syntax Principle
Define → Declare → Instruct → Result

Explicit Semantics, Implicit Syntax

Readable, Command-Line Native

Procedural Cascade Flow

| Feature               | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Paradigm**          | Instructional Procedural Modular          |
| **Error Handling**    | Passive Correct / Skip / Flag             |
| **Memory Management** | Explicit Stack/Heap/Mutex/Borrow/Wipe     |
| **Recursion**         | Silent + Async-Compatible                 |
| **Typing**            | Strong, Explicit, Implicit Inference OK   |
| **Use Case**          | Engineers, Logic Systems, Critical Design |
| **Command Mode**      | Fully CLI Controllable / AOT              |


🆕 What’s New:
📚 Use Standard Library
Now, inside .tpc files you can write:

tempercore
Copy
Edit
use stdlib

function test:
    let result = T.factorial(6)
    print result
And the compiler will:

✅ Inject from stdlib import TempercoreStdLib as T

✅ Compile it into valid Python

✅ Preserve compatibility with non-stdlib scripts
